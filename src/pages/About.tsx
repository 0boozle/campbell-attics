                We aren't a big company that sees you as just another client - we're a close-knit family team dedicated to helping Perth families declutter their homes, reclaim their garages, and store what matters in a safe space hidden in their roof.
              </p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                We understand that feeling confident climbing ladders and walking in your roof is of upmost importance. We value safety above all else and use only the most durable materials.
              </p>
              <p>
                We don't subcontract. We don't cut corners. We show up, get the job done right, and treat your home with the same care we'd give our own.

            <div className="prose prose-lg text-gray-600 space-y-6">
              <p>
                Campbell Attics didn't start with ladders or platforms - it started with roof repairs. We spent years inside Perth roof cavities patching leaks, and fixing structural faults.
              </p>
              <p>
                But over time, we saw something almost every homeowner missed: All that wasted space, just sitting empty hidden above their heads.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's when we saw an opportunity: Why just fix a roof, when we can transform it into something families can actually use?
              </p>
              <p>
                So we got to work. And we built a business around it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, after 20+ years in the trade, we help Perth families reclaim their homes with attic ladders, dust-proof storage rooms, and custom-built platforms - installed in just one day, backed by a 5-year guarantee.
